THIS IS HOW TO RUN OUR STUFF
g++ main.cpp setLL.cpp setLL.h node.cpp node.h MSetLL.h MSetLL.cpp mapLL.cpp mapLL.h mmapLL.cpp mmapLL.h -std=c++11

EXTRA CREDIT THAT WE DID
—toString for linked lists
—randomDraw for linked lists
—union for linked lists
—intersection for linked list
-removeOne for linked multimap linked list
—all extra credit completed for HM implementations
—randomDraw for multiset array
—attempted union and intersections for array

Dynamic Array was the fastest for all ADTs
